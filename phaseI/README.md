# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Everybody wants to be better at something, but not everybody knows how to develop reasonable goals and identify stepping stones to achieve them. Often we need encouragement and guidance but don't have a mentor who can tailor their experience to our needs. Catalyst is a platform meant to aid people on their growth journey by helping the user identify areas of personal growth, develop better habits, set achievable goals, coach and encourage them to help achieve them and provide tips and tricks to make their learning and growth experience more manageable. It's not a self-help book in the sense that people have to figure it out on their own, it's a platform that helps people get creative and motivated while they are trying to help themselves.

## Methods

Heuristic Evaluation: We evaluated the greatest competitor to our product and gave them scores based on a set of defined criteria

Competitive Analysis: We looked at potential competitors to our app. We studied our competitor's strengths, weaknesses, and target demographics.

## Findings

Competitive Analysis:

+ We found that our competitors generally had applications that were easy to use. We found that one of the places where our competitors were weak and presented an opportunity for our product was a lack of resources and customization. Another weakness we found was that features were limited to non-paid tier

Heuristic Evaluation:

+ Visibility of System Status (8/10)

Our team members agreed that the settings' visibility wasn't immediately apparent.
Once we located them, we found that manipulating the settings appeared to be straightforward and uncomplicated.

+ Match between the system and the real world (7/10)

Our team found it difficult initially to navigate the application. The learning curve associated with navigation was found to be steep.

+ User control and freedom (2/10)

Our team determined that the app's design and functionality were fixed and the app did not include any options for customization to tailor it to individual preferences. For example we could not find any options to prevent some of the unwanted pop-ups from interrupting our
user experience within the app.

+ Consistency and standards (9/10)

The app provides users with the features and functionalities they
would typically expect from a fitness or self-help application.

+ Error prevention (6/10)

We found the app to be lacking in its error prevention. It was great for checking for syntax-related errors, for example checking for letters when entering weight. However, our app lacked in checking for semantic errors demonstrated by its lack of any checks for the calorie count for its meal plans. The user could enter an absurd amount of calories.

+ Recognition rather than recall (9/10)

We gave our user a high score in the category "Recognition Rather Than Recall". Our competitor demonstrated this by having all relevant present on most pages.

+ Flexibility and efficiency of use (6/10)

Our competitor had many methods that allowed users to navigate the app efficiently. The app had many shortcuts, but there were learning curves toward recognizing and utilizing them.

+ Aesthetic and minimalist design (2/10)

Our competitor demonstrated great weakness in this category. Its interface appeared to be  chaotic and crowded, and it lacked organization. The main page, however, exhibited aesthetically pleasing and minimalist design principles.

+ Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (3/10)

Our competitor, as stated in the error prevention portion of the analysis, displayed weakness concerning recognizing certain semantic-based errors. In summary, our competitor seemed to have issues with recognizing errors

+ Help and documentation (9/10)

Our competitor provided clear instructions to allow users to complete tasks. Our competitors presented these in the form of visual aids such as pictures and diagrams.

## Conclusions

From the findings and research we have conducted, we have found significant insights into most personal growth apps on the market today. Within most of the competitor's applications not all functions are available to users when first starting the app due to paid subscriptions, is not customizable to the user's lifestyle, and there is a learning curve when first using competitor's apps. So from these findings, we can see that there is a struggle for the user's compatibility with the app because they cannot adapt it completely to their lifestyle. Some recommendations that can shape future work from these insights are allowing the users the full range of functionality of the app but using an ad-supported model to generate revenue without stringing along the user, allowing the user to change aspects of steps or information given from the app to tailor to the user's lifestyle, And a simple UI with an easy workflow to follow to overcome the learning curve from most personal growth applications. 

## Caveats

+ We did not have access to the paid version of any of these app

+ Many members of the group had limited access to apps that were exclusive to Android or Apple
