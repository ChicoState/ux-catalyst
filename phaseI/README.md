# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Everybody wants to be better at something, but not everybody knows how to develop reasonable goals and identify stepping stones in order to achieve them. Often times we need encouragement and guidance but don't have a mentor that can tailor their experience to our needs. Catalyst is a platform meant to aid people on their personal growth journey by helping the user identify areas of personal growth, develop better habits, set achievable goals, coach and encourage to help achieve them, provide tips and tricks to making their learning and growth experience more manageable. It's not a self help book in the sense that people have to figure it out on their own, it's a platform that helps people get creative and motivated while they are trying to help themselves.

## Methods

Competitive Analysis: We looked at potential competitors to our app. We studied our competitor's strengths, weaknesses, and target demographics.

## Findings

Competiive Analysis:

+ We found that our competitors generally had applications that were easy to use.

+ We found that one of the places that competitors were weak and presented an opprotunity for our product was a lack of resources and customization

Heuristic Evaluation:

+ Visibility of System Status (8/10)

+ Match between system and the real world (7/10)

+ User control and freedom (2/10)

+ Consistency and standards (9/10)

+ Error prevention (6/10)

+ Aesthetic and minimalist design (2/10)

+ Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (3/10)

+ Help and documentation (9/10)

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

+ We did not have access to the paid version of any of these app

+ Many memebers of the group had limited access to app that were exclusive to Android or Apple
