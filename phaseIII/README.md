# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

Within this interval of work, the focus was on evaluating various aspects of the app's functionality and usability through a series of tasks performed by users. Each task seeked to target a specific feature or function of the app, with the aim of assessing its effectiveness and user-friendliness.

Task 1 involved enabling users to input their personal health goals into the app, exemplified by a scenario where a user aimed to lose 30 pounds in a designated timeframe. This task served as a fundamental test of the app's core functionality â€“ the ability to set and track individual health objectives.

Task 2 focused on the social aspect of the app, requiring users to share their flexibility routine on a forum. This task not only tested the technical feasibility of sharing content within the app but also evaluates the intuitiveness of the interface for engaging with the community aspect of Catalyst.

Task 3 highlights the role of user support within the app, with the UX team prompting users to seek assistance from the forum to modify an existing goal. This task assesses both the accessibility of support features within the app and the effectiveness of community engagement in addressing user needs.

Task 4 revolved around the editing of existing exercises, indicating a focus on the app's capacity for customization and adaptation to users' evolving fitness routines. This task evaluated the ease of modifying content within the app to align with changing goals or preferences.

Finally, Task 5 involved the basic functionality of user account management, requiring users to sign out of the Catalyst app. While seemingly straightforward, this task ensured that essential user actions, such as logging out, are seamlessly integrated into the app's interface.

Overall, this interval of work within the Catalyst project aims to refine and validate the app's features, ensuring that it effectively addresses the diverse needs of its user base in pursuing their health and fitness goals. Through iterative testing and feedback, the team can iteratively improve the app's functionality and user experience, ultimately enhancing its value and utility to users.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
