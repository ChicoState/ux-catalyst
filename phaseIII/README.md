# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing


## Introduction

Within this interval of work, the focus was on evaluating various aspects of the app's functionality and usability through a series of tasks performed by users. Each task sought to target a specific feature or function of the app, intending to assess its effectiveness and user-friendliness.

Task 1 involved enabling users to input their personal health goals into the app, exemplified by a scenario where a user aimed to lose 30 pounds in a designated timeframe. This task served as a fundamental test of the app's core functionality â€“ the ability to set and track individual health objectives.

Task 2 focused on the social aspect of the app, requiring users to share their flexibility routine on a forum. This task not only tested the technical feasibility of sharing content within the app but also evaluated the intuitiveness of the interface for engaging with the community aspect of Catalyst.

Task 3 highlights the role of user support within the app, with the UX team prompting users to seek assistance from the forum to modify an existing goal. This task assesses both the accessibility of support features within the app and the effectiveness of community engagement in addressing user needs.

Task 4 revolved around the editing of existing exercises, indicating a focus on the app's capacity for customization and adaptation to users' evolving fitness routines. This task evaluated the ease of modifying content within the app to align with changing goals or preferences.

Finally, Task 5 involved the basic functionality of user account management, requiring users to sign out of the Catalyst app. While seemingly straightforward, this task ensured that essential user actions, such as logging out, were seamlessly integrated into the app's interface.

Overall, this interval of work within the Catalyst project aims to refine and validate the app's features, ensuring that it effectively addresses the diverse needs of its user base in pursuing their health and fitness goals. Through iterative testing and feedback, the team can iteratively improve the app's functionality and user experience, ultimately enhancing its value and utility to users.


## Methods

The research methods employed to gain new insights for the Catalyst project primarily involved a combination of wireframing, prototyping using Figma, and conducting user walkthrough studies. Each method served a specific purpose in the research process, aimed at informing the design and functionality of the app to better meet user needs and expectations.

In our Catalyst project, wireframing played a pivotal role as the initial step in our design process. By creating low-fidelity representations of the app's interface, we established a structural blueprint that outlined the layout and core functionality without incorporating visual design elements. This approach enabled rapid iteration, allowing us to explore different layout ideas, assess navigation flow, and ensure alignment with user requirements before delving into detailed design work. Importantly, wireframing laid the essential groundwork for building the prototype, guiding its development in Figma. Through wireframing, we could concentrate on refining the fundamental structure of the app, ensuring that our design decisions were grounded in user needs and expectations from the outset, ultimately setting the stage for the development of an intuitive and user-centered product.

During the prototype phase of our Catalyst project, we transitioned from wireframing to building interactive prototypes using Figma, marking a crucial step in refining the user experience. With the foundation laid by wireframes, we could now flesh out the app's functionality and design in greater detail. Prototyping allowed us to transform static wireframes into dynamic representations of the app, complete with clickable elements and simulated interactions. This transition from wireframes to prototypes enabled us to validate and iterate on design concepts more effectively.

During the user walkthrough phase of our Catalyst project, we organized sessions in a reserved room at Marium Library, providing a conducive environment for participants to engage with our prototypes. Utilizing Figma, participants conducted the walkthrough on laptops, interacting with the prototypes in a realistic digital environment. This setup allowed us to closely observe participants as they navigated through the app, providing valuable insights into usability, navigation flow, and overall user experience. By guiding participants through predefined tasks and scenarios, we gained firsthand feedback on the app's functionality and design, identifying areas for improvement and validation.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify discoveries of users' needs !!!

Our user walkthrough studies revealed several key insights into the usability and functionality of Catalyst. By analyzing participant experiences and task completion metrics, we gained valuable perspectives on areas of strength and opportunities for improvement within the app.

Participants generally succeeded in adding goals, with varying completion times reflecting differences in navigation fluency. For instance, participants like p01, a tech-savvy college student, grasped the process quickly, achieving a high success rate and rating. In contrast, participants with less experience, such as p02, encountered minor challenges but still completed the task efficiently. These findings suggest that while Catalyst's goal-setting feature is generally intuitive, there may be room for further streamlining to accommodate users with diverse levels of familiarity with self-help apps.

Task 2, which involved utilizing drag functionality to share content to the forum, presented notable challenges across participants. Success rates varied, with some, like p04, encountering only minor difficulties, while others, like p05, struggled to grasp the drag feature, resulting in longer completion times. Notably, participant feedback highlighted the need for clearer guidance on drag functionality, as evidenced by comments from p01 and p03. These findings underscore the importance of refining drag functionality to enhance user understanding and satisfaction.

Sharing to the forum, Task 3, was relatively straightforward for participants already familiar with the forum interface, such as p02. However, navigation issues were reported by some, indicating a need for improved clarity in app navigation. Participants like p03 highlighted the importance of intuitive pathways to streamline user interactions and minimize friction during task completion.

Task 4, editing exercises, demonstrated varied difficulty levels, with navigation challenges affecting completion times for some participants. This suggests the necessity of refining navigation pathways within the app to ensure seamless user experiences. Additionally, glitches experienced by participants like p06 underscored potential technical issues that may impact user satisfaction.

Signing out, Task 5, was generally straightforward, yet glitches experienced by one participant highlighted potential technical issues that may impact user experiences. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing technical glitches promptly to maintain user satisfaction and trust.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the data we gathered from User Testing in turn helped us to discover the need to rethink the drag feature to share with the forum. It also helped us see the trouble that arose in task 4 with changing the exercise and sets, taking this into mind moving forward it is clear we need to take a step back and reassess our approach to both of these features. From the design recommendations based on the latest user insights, A lot of users mentioned scraping the idea of the drag feature or at least making it much clearer that you can drag goals to the forum. In addition, adding the share feature to the pull-out drawer or profile was an idea since some users tried to go with that approach at first versus reading the text below mentioning the drag feature. As for the changing exercises feature, since most of the users agreed that having to search and find the exact exercise to change was surprisingly difficult, a shortcut of some sort would be a good path to try but overall making the features much more clear of what they do is the overall message we received from the user's recommendations of what they would change about the prototype.    


## Caveats

One of the bigger caveats we considered with the methods we chose, as well as the findings and conclusions drawn from them was not everyone will understand how everything will work even from the prototype. Our idea and vision of the app as a group could not transfer to the users who were coming in and only had past knowledge of other self-help apps they may have used in the past. Not one user knew what we were trying to do differently so it may have seemed confusing since not everyone else was doing it the same way. We also have the other caveat of the certain tools we had at our disposal which did not allow us to completely make our true idea come to fruition since the program could only do so much for being a low-maintenance yet effective way of making the basic structures of an app. So as a user, that may not have completely allowed them to truly experience the complete app experience, clicking through multiple pages with features that are flawless and discovering the layout of everything.
