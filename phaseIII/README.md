# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!
For Task 1 our user played the role of an individual who wanted to lose 30 pounds in 3 months. We wanted the user to add this to the goals section of the app. We created this task in order to test the main functionality of the app, which is to add goals. For Task 2 we wanted the user to share their flexibility routine to the forum. This task was important because it served as a test as to whether or not the concept of dragging goals to a forum was intuitive and workable. In Task 3 the UX team wanted the user to get help from the forum to change an existing goal. For Task 4, we wanted the user to edit an existing exercise. Finally, in Task 5, we wanted the user to sign out of Catalyst.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
