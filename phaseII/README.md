# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!
During the last sprint, our primary objective was to finalize the functionality of the user interface (UI), laying the groundwork for a seamless transition towards bolstering backend capabilities in the upcoming sprint. The UI enhancements aimed to provide users with a more intuitive and engaging experience, facilitating easier navigation and interaction with the platform. Key features implemented during this phase include the user homepage, offering a centralized hub for accessing various functionalities, and the integration of social elements, allowing users to view and interact with the activities of others. Additionally, the implementation of selective sharing functionality empowers users to control the dissemination of their own activities, fostering a sense of privacy and personalization. Furthermore, efforts were directed towards enriching the user experience by providing more contextually relevant information pertaining to selected tasks, aiding users in making informed decisions and achieving their objectives efficiently. These enhancements collectively contribute to the overarching goal of creating a robust and user-centric platform that caters to the diverse needs and preferences of our user base.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!
Cognitive Walkthrough

+The Cognitive Walkthrough method involved engaging external users to test our wireframes and assess the usability and effectiveness of our application's interface.

Steps

+ Task Identification: We identified specific tasks or scenarios that users would typically perform within the application. These tasks were selected to represent key user goals and interactions with the system.

+ Participant Recruitment: Students undergoing a similar assignment chose projects to do the walkthrough on.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
