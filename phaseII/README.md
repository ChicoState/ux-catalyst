# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The main goal of the last sprint was to decide what the UI's main functionality would look and function so that we could switch the focus to increasing backend functionality for the next sprint. We executed this by creating wireframes of the main pages for the application along with how the UI will mainly look. We also had the main buttons displayed to show the crucial features.  

## Methods

For us to further develop our application and discover new insights, we had a cognitive walkthrough of our wireframes. We recruited our classmates, who are also working on similar projects, to act as one of the personas we created and accomplish the goal that was created for that specific persona. For example, one of the personas we created was named "Bruce Seumanutafa", Bruce usually has the same two-week routine for his workouts. He loves doing the same workouts over and over again however The problem is that his clients feel that the workouts are too redundant and boring. From that description, we wanted our classmates to see if they could manage their way as Bruce in creating a new workout plan through the wireframes provided. 


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
We discovered A few caveats during this sprint, the first being that as the UX team, we are unsure how much further the SE team has developed the application. So we are unclear as to how exactly everything looks until we receive updates on how the application is doing, and so by the time we decide on possibly excluding/including something in the final prototype the SE team possibly has already developed that specific tool to near completion. The second caveat is that during the cognitive walkthrough, our classmates did not clearly understand what we saw as the final product and what we wanted to accomplish from it. So having somewhat low-fidelity wireframes could not completely capture the idea that is present for our team's final project.
