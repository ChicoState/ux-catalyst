# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The main goal of the last sprint was to decide what the UI's main functionality would look and function so that we could switch the focus to increasing backend functionality for the next sprint. We executed this by creating wireframes of the main pages for the application along with how the UI will mainly look. We also had the main buttons displayed to show the crucial features.  

## Methods

For us to further develop our application and discover new insights, we had a cognitive walkthrough of our wireframes. We recruited our classmates, who are also working on similar projects, to act as one of the personas we created and accomplish the goal that was created for that specific persona. For example, one of the personas we created was named "Bruce Seumanutafa", Bruce usually has the same two-week routine for his workouts. He loves doing the same workouts over and over again however The problem is that his clients feel that the workouts are too redundant and boring. From that description, we wanted our classmates to see if they could manage their way as Bruce in creating a new workout plan through the wireframes provided. 


## Findings

The data provided to do the cognitive walkthrough was the initial design of the wireframes for Catalyst. What we found was that users consider the forum the main part of the app when it is simply an addition to it with other users being able to help one another. It was discovered that we underdeveloped the wireframes by showing just the main buttons and parts of the UI. We did not follow through to the end with each function, confusing users when looking at the main functions and what comes next. Many of the users did not know what happens after they click the add goal button. Some of the cognitive walkthroughs mentioned that they did not know if they were logged in or had an account was mentioned throughout many of the cognitive walkthroughs. We also found that the wireframes do not specify whether the user successfully added a goal, making it hard for the users to understand if they are using the application correctly.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
We discovered A few caveats during this sprint, the first being that as the UX team, we are unsure how much further the SE team has developed the application. So we are unclear as to how exactly everything looks until we receive updates on how the application is doing, and so by the time we decide on possibly excluding/including something in the final prototype the SE team possibly has already developed that specific tool to near completion. The second caveat is that during the cognitive walkthrough, our classmates did not clearly understand what we saw as the final product and what we wanted to accomplish from it. So having somewhat low-fidelity wireframes could not completely capture the idea that is present for our team's final project.
