# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The main goal of the last sprint was to have the UI's functionality done to switch the focus to increasing backend functionality for the previous sprint. Some of these functionalities include the user homepage, the ability to see what others are doing, selectively share what the user is doing, and see more relevant information to complete that task once that task is chosen. 

## Methods

For us to further develop our application and discover new insights, we had a cognitive walkthrough of our wireframes. We recruited our classmates, who are also working on similar projects, to act as one of the personas we created and accomplish the goal that was created for that specific persona. For example, one of the personas we created was named "Bruce Seumanutafa", Bruce usually has the same two-week routine for his workouts. He loves doing the same workouts over and over again however The problem is that his clients feel that the workouts are too redundant and boring. From that description, we wanted our classmates to see if they could manage their way as Bruce in creating a new workout plan through the wireframes provided. 


Steps

+ Task Identification: We identified specific tasks or scenarios that users would typically perform within the application. These tasks were selected to represent key user goals and interactions with the system.

+ Participant Recruitment: Students undergoing a similar assignment chose projects to do the walkthrough on.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
